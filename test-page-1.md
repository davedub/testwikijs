### Test Page 1

This page ("create new document") is initiated and edited inside the Wiki.js editor. 

Let's save the document and then make sure it gets pushed to the Heroku app where content is stored. 

If all works as planned, wait a few minutes and see whether it shows up there. 

Once it does, got ahead and pull from there (`$ git pull origin master`) to your local repository for further editing.
